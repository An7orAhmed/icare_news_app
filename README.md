A Flutter project for 'Task-Based Round' assignment in Interactive Cares job.

## Behind the scenes

So, in the past, I didn't have any experience with Riverpod or Bloc because when I was learning Flutter, I chose Provider for state management since it was recommended by Flutter at that time. Later on, I learned about GetX and found it to be easier than Provider.

However, In this assignment specifically required me to use either Riverpod or Bloc. Initially, I was hesitant, but then I realized that if I don't take on new challenges, I won't be able to learn new technologies. So, I decided to give it a try. I did some research online to compare which state management approach is better in 2023, and most of the results pointed to Riverpod.

I started learning Riverpod and began working on the project. Alhamdulillah, I was able to learn and develop the app in just two days. Regardless of whether I get the job or not, I feel accomplished because I learned something new.

Thanks.
